## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```python
# Create a maze environment
config = Config(maze_size=10, visualization_delay=0.3)
env = MazeEnvironment(config)

# Create a BFS algorithm
bfs = BreadthFirstSearch(env)

# Run the search
result = bfs.run()

# Print the results
print(result)

# Visualize the final state
env.visualize(path=result.path, visited=set(result.visited))
```

### Step-by-Step Visualization

```python
config = Config(maze_size=5, show_exploration=True)
env = MazeEnvironment(config)

# Create an instance of the search algorithm
bfs = BreadthFirstSearch(env)

# Run and visualize
result = bfs.run()
bfs.visualize_search(result)
```

### Compare Multiple Algorithms

```python
config = Config(maze_size=10)
env = MazeEnvironment(config)

# Create algorithm instances
algorithms = [BreadthFirstSearch(env)]
# Add other algorithms as they are implemented

# Create visualizer
visualizer = MazeSearchVisualizer(env, algorithms)

# Run comparison
results_df = visualizer.compare_algorithms()

# Visualize comparison
visualizer.visualize_comparison(results_df)
```

### Run Experiments

```python
# Create experiment manager
experiments = MazeExperiments()

# Run experiments for different maze sizes
maze_sizes = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
algorithm_classes = [BreadthFirstSearch]

# Run experiments
results = experiments.run_maze_size_experiment(
    algorithm_classes, 
    maze_sizes, 
    iterations=3
)

# Visualize results
experiments.visualize_maze_size_experiment(results)
```

### Educational Dashboard

```python
config = Config(maze_size=5, show_exploration=True, visualization_delay=0.8)
env = MazeEnvironment(config)

# Create enhanced BFS instance
bfs = BreadthFirstSearch(env)

# Run the search and collect educational results
result = bfs.run()

# Create an educational dashboard
dashboard = BFSEducationalDashboard(env, result)

# Visualize a specific step
dashboard.visualize_step(3)

# Create animations
dashboard.create_gif(fps=1.5)
dashboard.animate_bfs_on_graph(fps=3, size=6)
```

## Example Output

### BFS Search Visualization

When running the step-by-step visualization, you'll see an animated display of the BFS algorithm in action. Each step shows:

- The current maze state with color-coded cells:
  - White: Unvisited path cells
  - Yellow: Visited cells
  - Blue: Start position
  - Purple: Goal position
  - Green: Current path
  - Lightblue: Frontier queue
  - Red: Currently expanded node

- Educational information:
  - Current step number
  - Expanded node coordinates
  - Neighbors discovered
  - Queue state before and after expansion
  - Detailed explanation of BFS concepts

### Results and Metrics

The `SearchResult` provides comprehensive metrics about the search:

```
‚úÖ Search succeeded in 14 steps (0.003s)
üìè Path length: 9 nodes
üîç Visited nodes: 15 nodes (1.07 nodes/step)
‚öôÔ∏è Efficiency: 60.0% (path nodes / visited nodes)
üå≤ Average branching factor: 1.50 neighbors/node
‚è±Ô∏è Average time per step: 0.21 ms
```

### Educational Dashboard

The BFS Educational Dashboard provides:

1. Interactive step-by-step visualization
2. Algorithm state visualization with queue operations
3. Educational explanations of BFS concepts
4. GIF animations of the search process
5. Graph representation visualization

### Experiment Results

Experiment results are visualized with multiple charts:

1. Success Rate by Maze Size
2. Avg. Visited Nodes by Maze Size
3. Avg. Execution Time by Maze Size
4. Avg. Path Optimality by Maze Size

These visualizations help understand how BFS performance scales with different maze sizes.
